Python code

The attached files are my practice codes of python.

I have attached about 7 files in which i written python codes. In classes file, I just coded class employee, defined few variables and init method.
In the init method, attributes are defined inside the brackect.
And finally called the function at end of the function that displays the output we wanted.
if and else function is defined under an another function.

In lab.py file, the code generates a code for student from their data.
To generate a code, inputs are taken from the users and print statement is printed atlast.
In modeule.py, class person is defined to print the age and name of the person . It also includes init method, defined functions and deleting of an elements in python.
The codes are tested by various duplicate elements.

One of the files includes import math method that supports mathematical functions like square root and many.
if __name__ == "__main__": is used to call more than a one function.
return function also used in few codes.
A simple Python function is coded in wed.py file to check whether x is even or odd. Driver code is used to call the function.
This structured approach will help us convey a clear and comprehensive description of Python code in your assessments.
